<h1 align="center">Transliteration from Russian characters to ASCII Extension for Yii 2</h1>

This extension is primarily for translate russian text to ASCII to produce file names understandable by most filesystems and network protocols without converting to unicode yet readable (and understandable) by humans.

**NOTE**: this extension is very ad-hoc, i.e. works only for fixed (hard coded) UTF-8 encoded russian cyrillic characters.
